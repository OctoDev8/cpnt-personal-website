        <p> Emotional turmoil, stress and daily adversity piles up on us therefore what can we do to reduce extra blight that grinds us down? A complicated question that multiple philosophies try to answer but we will focus specifically on Zen philosophy for this blog.</p>
        <h2>Mindfulness</h2>
        <p>The concept of being fully present in the moment. Wholly focusing on the task or action that you are doing and not getting distracted by stressors or thoughts that have lingered for a long time is difficult to do.
            Zen's main aim is on being mindful, and taking the time to be grateful for simple moments that provide even the slightest respite from all the troubles of daily life.
            Subsequently, Zazen or meditating techniques encompass the holistic approach where you focus entirely on a single task whether its breathing, art, sitting or standing.
            Often times people mistake that when meditating, you absolutely can not get distracted. However, the process is not about austerity rather its about acknowledging the distractions that you face and ground yourself to focus back on the task at hand.
            This is a normal occurence and if you had done this, do not be harsh on yourself. To distinguish the line between mindfulness and discipline can be a difficult subconscious process when you are a beginner since you might feel that it is a set rule that you can not be distracted.
            Instead you must remember that this process of Zen is not about being ascetic, it is a relaxed journey, one you can switch on or off. Even if you found that you were harsh on yourself, this is a good lesson!
            Finding about yourself, your thought processes, the negative and the positive is an integral aspect of Zen methodology.
